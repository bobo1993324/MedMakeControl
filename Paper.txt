Control system:
The control system aims at controlling the process of chemical reaction according to users' script and feedback from the temperature sensor. It contains a relay device, three temperature monitors and a computer. 
The relay device contains forty relays that activates heater and pistons in the reaction chip to control the chemical reaction process. It has a built-in interface that can be accessed through serial connection.
The temperature monitors read sensors in the reaction chip and sends the temperature data through serial connection when requested.
The main program runs on a computer that is connected to other device by serial connections. It parses a text file as a custom script that defines the procedure of reaction. In execution mode, it sends commands to relay device and reads data from temperature monitors to decide whether one procedure is finished.
The syntax of the custom script is fairly simple considering the chemical engineers intends to design reactions without any previous computer programming experience. It supports simple commands such as to open relay No.34 as "open 34" and to wait until user press a "Resume" button on the user interface as "wait". It also supports loops with fixed number of repetition. For complex operations such as to heat a cell to a certain temperature and keep the temperature for a while, the logic is programmed in java and is built-in the program for custom script to access.
Java is the language for the main program for multiple platform support. The user interface is built by Swing. RXTX library is used to access serial port. Thanks to jfreechart library, we are able to output the temperature as a graph.
